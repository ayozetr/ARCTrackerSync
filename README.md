# ARCTracker Sync

ARCTracker Sync keeps your [ARCTracker](https://arctracker.io) inventory up to
date while you play ARC Raiders. It signs you into ARCTracker, helps you start
the game from Steam or Epic, and then connects your game account so ARCTracker
can sync your inventory automatically in the background.

It runs as a small desktop app — a polished Windows build with a tray icon, plus
a build-from-source option for Linux (ARC Raiders via Proton). Once it's set up,
you mostly leave it alone — open it, start your game, and play.

> **License:** ARCTracker Sync is **free for noncommercial use** under the
> PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0. **Commercial use requires a separate
> license** — contact matt@arctracker.io. See [License](#license) below.

## Installing

1. Download the latest `arctracker-sync-<version>-windows-x64.zip` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/RaidTheory/ARCTrackerSync/releases) page.
2. Unzip it anywhere and run `arctracker-sync.exe`.

The app is currently unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may warn you the first time
you run it. It also asks for **Administrator** permission on launch (see
[Why it needs Administrator](#why-it-needs-administrator)).

Once installed, ARCTracker Sync updates itself: it checks for new releases on
GitHub and, when you approve, downloads and installs them. Each download is
verified against a published checksum before it's applied.

### Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit.
- ARC Raiders on **Steam** or the **Epic Games Store**.
- An ARCTracker account.

## Using it

1. **Sign in to ARCTracker.** The app opens your browser to sign in, then
   remembers you using Windows Credential Manager so you don't have to sign in
   every time.
2. **Choose your launcher.** Pick Steam or Epic. Steam can launch ARC Raiders
   directly; for Epic you may need to point the app at the game once.
3. **Prepare and launch.** The app gets your launcher ready, then you start ARC
   Raiders from Steam or Epic as usual.
4. **Play.** While you play, ARCTracker Sync connects your game account and
   ARCTracker keeps your inventory in sync. The main screen shows your sign-in,
   game selection, launch, connection, and sync status at a glance.

Troubleshooting details are tucked away by default — you can open them if you
need to dig into what's happening. For more help, see

### Your privacy

ARCTracker Sync does **not** store your ARC Raiders / game-account credentials on
your machine. Setup data stays local, and the only thing it sends to ARCTracker
is the account-connection update needed to keep your inventory in sync. Your
ARCTracker sign-in is kept in Windows Credential Manager.

### Why it needs Administrator

To notice your game account connecting, ARCTracker Sync watches your own
computer's network traffic using raw sockets, which the OS only allows with
elevated privileges. On Windows that means Administrator rights; on Linux it
means the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability (granted with a one-time `setcap`, or by
running as root) — see [Linux](#linux-arc-raiders-via-proton). By default
there's no kernel driver, bundled network library, or extra capture tool to
install — and it only ever looks at traffic on your own machine.

### Optional: Npcap capture

Some antivirus products (Avast Web Shield, for example) interfere with
raw-socket capture. If sync won't connect on your machine, Settings → Network
lets you switch the capture method to **Npcap**, a separately installed
packet-capture driver from <https://npcap.com>. ARCTracker Sync never bundles,
downloads, or installs Npcap — its license forbids redistribution — so if you
select Npcap without installing it, the app tells you and links to npcap.com.
With Npcap selected, the app loads Npcap's `wpcap.dll` at runtime and captures
through Npcap's kernel driver instead of raw sockets. It still only looks at
traffic on your own machine, and Administrator is still required.

## Building from source

You don't need to build the app to use it — grab a release above. To build it
yourself:

Prerequisites:

- A stable Rust toolchain on the MSVC target (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
- Windows 10 or 11, x64.

From the repository root:

```powershell
cargo build --release
cargo run
```

The app ships a manifest that requests elevation, so it runs as Administrator
(required for the raw-socket capture described above). No kernel driver or
external tooling is needed for the default raw-socket capture; the optional
Npcap capture method uses Npcap's driver, installed separately by the user.

### Linux (ARC Raiders via Proton)

Windows is the primary, prebuilt target. Linux is supported as a
**build-from-source** option for running ARC Raiders through Proton — there is
no Linux release binary.

Prerequisites:

- A stable Rust toolchain (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)).
- ARC Raiders on **Steam** (the Epic launcher isn't supported on Linux).

No `-dev` packages are needed: the tray is Windows-only, and the file dialogs
go through the XDG desktop portal over D-Bus rather than linking GTK.

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/run-linux.sh
```

That builds the release binary, grants it `CAP_NET_RAW` with a one-time
`sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep` (so the GUI itself runs unprivileged, the Linux
equivalent of the Windows Administrator requirement), and launches it.

See [docs/LINUX.md](docs/LINUX.md) for how capture works under Proton, the
`SSLKEYLOGFILE` setup, a capture smoke test, and current caveats.
